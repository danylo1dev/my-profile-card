# 🚀 My Awesome Developer Card 🚀

Hey there, fellow coders and curious onlookers! 👋 This is my super cool, totally rad developer card built with React. It's like a digital business card, but way more interactive.

This project showcases my skills, and a little bit about me. I hope you enjoy it!

## Tech Stack 🛠️

Built with the magic of:

- **React:** Because who doesn't love reusable components? ❤️
- **CSS:** For making things look pretty ✨

## Getting Started 🏃‍♂️

Wanna run this bad boy locally? Easy peasy lemon squeezy! 🍋 Just follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the Repo:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/danylo1dev/my-profile-card
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Start the Development Server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This will fire up the development server, and your project should magically appear in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`. ✨ If it doesn't, try turning it off and on again. Just kidding (mostly). 😅
